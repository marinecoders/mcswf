## Svelte

Svelte is a modern JavaScript compiler that allows you to write easy-to-understand JavaScript code which is then compiled to highly efficient code that runs in the browser. In this project, Svelte is used to create interactive UI components.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that is highly customizable and allows you to build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML. In this project, Tailwind CSS is used for styling the UI components.

| `npm run dev`   | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321` |
| `npm run build` | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of the project you'll see this basic file structure:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The components are organized into buttons, cards, dropdown, elements (other basic code blocks reused across the site), sections (used for sections of pages), and utils.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
