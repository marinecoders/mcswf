For the first four months, Marines will attend a technical accelerator to establish a baseline skillset. Then, Marines will work one-to-one with technical experts from industry while solving real Marine problem sets. Marines who successfully complete the enablement phase will receive the 0673 Necessary Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) (Application Developer). Marines will spend the final 24 months in a utilization tour building Marine Corps software solutions while continuing to advance their skillsets."
