about: >
  Software Development Engineers are responsible for creating, refining, and launching applications. They prioritize high availability, minimal latency, and scalability. Their approach is to first implement user stories from the backlog and adopt a test-first methodology. This strategy helps them to ensure that the software is free of bugs or security vulnerabilities.


  Additionally, Software Engineers engage in eXtreme Programming (XP), a collaborative method where pairs of engineers simultaneously work on the same code segment. This facilitates knowledge sharing and context understanding.
